You can place the automated pull script in your Windows start up folder so thet when you turn on your PC,
after a few seconds the batch file will execute and it will pull from the repository/repositories of your choice.
You can copy and update the commands to add more repositories, just point at the correct location.

** Access windows start up folder by typing "run" into windows search, followed by "shell:startup" **

The push script I leave on the desktop and click to execute when needed
